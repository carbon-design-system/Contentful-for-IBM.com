Your list of competitors will depend on the need you’re trying to fulfill.\n\nIf your ambitions are to produce the best coffee in the city, your competitor list might look something like this:\n\n- Starbucks\n- Keurig\n- Your local artisanal coffee shop\n\nBut on the other hand, if your ambitions are to create an environment conducive to positive informal social interactions (meetings, first dates, etc.), your competitor list might look something like this:\n\n- Happy hour\n- Cocktail bar\n- Afternoon tea\n\nIf you’re competing on the merit of your coffee, you have one path to win: make better coffee. From day one you’ll worry about the proliferation of new home coffee systems, new brewing methods and techniques, and shifts in people’s preferences from coffee to tea.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re competing on the merit of a social environment, you’re going to win on the merit of the space, and how well it facilitates “hanging out.” You’ll want to watch changes in social norms and how people connect are going to inform your decisions more than others — for example, online dating preferences, or whether or not it’s socially acceptable to go up and say hello to a complete stranger.\n\n## Types of competition\n\n- Direct competitors: Who else is showing up to the same deals? Who else shows up in keyword searches?\n- Indirect competitors: Who is fulfilling the user need in different ways? Who fulfills an adjacent need in the same market?\n- Potential entrants: Who is using the same functionality to fulfill a different need? Who fulfills a similar need, but in another market?\n"

          "en-US": "# Risks\n\nAll business comes with risks. Every time we invest in a new initiative, we run the risk of that initiative not returning on its investment. When we invite a non-IBMer to speak at an IBM conference, we run the risk that they end up bad-mouthing us on stage to a room full of potential customers.\n\nWe take these risks because we trust that the appropriate steps have been taken to minimize risks, and the consequences associated with these risks.\n\nConducting competitive analysis also comes with a set of potential risks. If conducted incorrectly, we risk: \n\n\n## Breaching the terms of a contract/license\n\nEvery time we use a competitor offering, we are subject to their terms of the agreement. We’ll cover this later, but it’s important to ensure that you adhere to these agreements. Failure to adhere can result in lawsuits that bring harm to IBM and your career.\n\n## Infringing on a copyright\n\nWhen you analyze a competitor offering, you’ll inevitably learn a thing or two. Some of the things you will encounter are considered intellectual property, whether they are explicitly labeled or not. For this reason, it’s important to never use any material you aren’t authorized to use.\n\n## Breaching a confidentiality agreement\n\nSome of our encounters with our competitors happen in settings where we’ve been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, such as a non-discloure form. In this case, using proprietary information you learned during the engagement is off-limits.\n\n## Committing a Trade Secret Violation\n\nTrade secrets are a form of intellectual property organizations generate. They can come in many forms, including certain design patterns, practices and process, or any other information a business can use to gain a competitive advantage, and that isn’t generally available to the public. Stealing (acquiring it by improper means) or misappropriating (using it without consent) a trade secret is a crime.\n\nWe take these risks to IBM seriously. Not only do these damage our reputation as a company of integrity, but if someone decides to bring a suit against us, it can result in financial loss to the company. Someone might file a suit if they even think that we copied them.\n\nThis isn’t meant to discourage you from competitive analysis. On the contrary, IBM encourages teams to conduct competitive analysis, as long as we take steps to minimize risk. By putting the right safeguards in place and conducting ourselves ethically, we can learn about our competitors and minimize the risk to IBM.\n\n# Restrictions\n\nThere are restrictions to who can do the analysis and which competitors you can analyze. \n\n## Who can conduct competitive analysis?\n\nThe only people explicitly forbidden from conducting competitive analyses are developers. If you are a developer, you are not permitted to conduct a competitive analysis.\n\nYou are a developer if you engage in any of these activities on your current project or offering team:\n\n- Define or design program logic flow for IBM software products.\n- Write code that shapes an API, GUIs, etc. (yes, front-end developers count) for IBM software products.\n- Do technical research that might end up in future program logic flows.\n\nIf you’re not sure whether you fall under this category, ask your manager or someone else in your reporting chain. They should be able to determine whether or not you’re a developer.\n\n## Which competitors can I analyze?\n\nYou can analyze any competitor offering, as long as the competitor’s fine print (often called the “Terms of Use” or “Terms of Service”) doesn’t explicitly forbid it.\n\nThe language in those Terms of Use language can get pretty gory, so make sure to contact your IP Law Department to help you review the competitor’s terms of use.\n\nHere are some examples of language that explicitly forbids competitive analysis. This includes license agreement that prohibits reverse-engineering: \n\n\n### Salesforce Heroku\n\nYou may use the Heroku Services only to develop and run applications on the Heroku infrastructure. You may not access the Heroku Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Heroku or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Heroku Services. https://www.heroku.com/policy/aup\n\n### Amazon Rekognition\n\nYou will not, and will not allow any third-party to, use Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, or Amazon Rekognition to, indirectly or directly, develop or improve a similar or competing product or service. https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/\n\n## What content am I allowed to analyze?\n\nGenerally speaking, you you are not allowed to analyze things that makes the product work. You’re not allowed to reverse-engineer, which in software terms, means analyzing anything that has to do with program logic flow or code.\n\nHowever, there’s a lot that you can analyze. Generally speaking, things that a normal user or customer would also use, or have access to, are fair game.\n\nHere are some examples of language that explicitly forbids competitive analysis. This includes license agreement that prohibits reverse-engineering:\n\n### Program logic flow: NO\n\nReverse-engineering program logic flow is explicitly forbidden. Trying to determine how a software tool calls data from a database, analyzes it, and then sends it to a front-end component is an example of something that would be considered reverse-engineering.\n\n### Code: NO\n\nAnalyzing source code, whether client or server, handwritten or procedurally generated, is also considered reverse-engineering. Stay away from that monospaced demon.\n\n### User experience: YES\n\nWhat’s an end user’s perception of a competitor offering? How does that stack against our own competing offering? This isn’t only legal –– we really need you to do this, please.\n\n### Features and functions: YES\n\nGenerally speaking, you’re allowed to analyze a competitor’s feature and function set. Keep in mind, however, that competitor offerings sometimes include exposure to code they wrote. Take as many precautions as you can to avoid contact.\n\n### Performance: YES\n\nWondering what the load times on a product page is? Trying to benchmark the time it takes to analyze a large data set? You are welcome to conduct performance benchmarks, so long as they don't require exposure to the program logic.\n\n### Licensing and pricing: YES\n\nWondering what users and customers can get for their money? Curious to see what’s included in their freemium version versus their paid version? You are free to analyze their pricing, read their licensing, etc.\n\n# Required approvals\n\nThere are a few approvals you’ll need to get before actually conducting the analysis.\n\n## Your IP Law Department\n\nEach business unit has a designated IP Law contact. Ask your manager if you don’t already know who this is.\n\n## A Vice President in your business\n\nIt might be hard to get 30 minutes on their calendar, but they’ll certainly respond to a simple email request. If you feel like they might take some convincing, bring the IP lawyer into the loop. Usually they can work it out together.\n\n# Follow-up\n\n## Mark the analysis confidential\n\nRecords of access and reports generated from assessment of non-IBM offerings are classified “IBM Confidential” as described in IBM Corporate Instruction LEG116, “Classification and control of IBM information.”\n\nBy default, all data in the Journey System tool is marked IBM Confidential.\n\n## Disclose your competitive analysis\n\nIf you conduct a competitive analysis and the information you gained helped to inform a decision that affected your offering in some way, make sure to disclose it.\n\nBefore an IBM offering is disclosed, announced, or offering for sale or lease, there’s a pretty stringent review process conducted by the IP Law office. In this process, they make sure that you aren’t infringing on someone’s intellectual property. This review will result in a Certificate of Originality.\n"

Today’s automobile is just another prototype for tomorrow’s transportation breakthrough. Every new solution is just an iteration on how people fulfill a need, shaped by the technological affordances and constraints of the era. But the problem at its core is defined by a fundamental human need: to get from A to B.\n\nTo deliver great outcomes, we must put user needs ahead of our internal business units, offerings, processes, and incentive structures. We’ll do this by understanding what a user needs to accomplish, providing end-to end journeys to fulfill the need, and measuring our success by the quality of our customers’ experience.\n\n## Determining a need\nThe most critical step in building a journey is knowing the user and how well IBM meets the user’s need. Needs statements are only as reliable as the data you have, so make sure you have defensible data based on real observation (for example, from an Interview or Contextual Inquiry).\n\n### Primary generative design research\nPrimary generative design research is a human-centered design practice that uncovers new opportunities by gathering empirical data directly from end users, in order to developing a deep understanding of what they need and desire.\n\n### Client use case identification\nClients and their requests are a valuable source of data to inform user needs. Have a conversation with your prospective clients to understand what problems they’re looking to solve. But beware: clients don’t always represent the end users in their organization.\n\n### Secondary market opportunity research\nMarket opportunity research seeks to understand the market landscape for a given user need: How many people have that need? How much are they willing to pay to fulfill it? What competitors are fulfilling the need?\n\n### Everyone can play a role\n\n- Offering managers help define the need by assessing trends in the market, etc.\n- Designers help define the need by contributing user research about gaps and pain points\n- Data Scientists help define the need by contributing consumption and top drivers data.\n- Client Representatives can help define the need by meeting with clients and reporting back successes and failures.\n\n## Writing a need statement\n\nA need represents a user's _definition of problem-solved._\n\nA need can be written many ways, but as a best practice, they must contains these critical elements: (when) the need arises, (what) the need is, and the (why) that the user will receive as a benefit.\n\n> When I see a patient, I need a way to take their vitals, so I can assess their health.\n\n## Tips\n\n### Avoid calling out a specific tool\nUsers and customers don’t care about offerings, tools, or specific technologies. They care about is getting their job done––and they will measure us on how well we help them do that job. Their fundamental need is agnostic of the tools and technology used to solve it. \n\n#### Incorrect\n > Use a stethoscope to determine a patient’s heart rate.\n \n#### Correct\n> When I see a patient, I need a way to take their vitals, so I can assess their health.\n\n#### Incorrect\n>  Purchase items from an enterprise catalog.\n\n#### Correct\n>  A new hire joining a team gets the equipment they need to immediately contribute to their team’s effort.\n\n### Avoid writing a Hill\nMarkets evolve quickly, but human needs evolve slowly. The qualities that differentiates a solution continuously evolve as social expectations and technological capabilities evolve. \n\nAs you learn more about market conditions and user expectations, you can use Hills to specify what we need to achieve to deliver a competitive solution. \n\n#### Hill\n> A system administrator can move hundreds of petabytes of data from their on-premise systems to the cloud within days, not weeks.\n\n#### Need\n> As a system administrator, I want to selectively migrate applications and data from on-premise systems to the cloud.\n\n### Synthesize similar needs\nAs you conduct research across different clients and industries, you’ll find patterns and common reference architectures emerge. Some needs look different on the surface, but are actually very similar under the hood. Where possible, strive for more general needs instead of industry-specific ones. \n\n#### Industry-specific\n> I want to understand the health of my fleet’s engine stock so I can anticipate maintenance events and minimize aircraft downtime.\n\n#### General\n> Understand the health of my equipment so my company can anticipate maintenance events and keep them running."
